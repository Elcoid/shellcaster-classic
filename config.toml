# Shellcaster settings
# --------------------

# Specifies where podcast episodes that are downloaded will be stored.
# Defaults:
# $XDG_DATA_HOME/shellcaster/ or $HOME/.local/share/shellcaster/ on Linux
# $HOME/Library/Application Support/shellcaster/ on Mac
# C:\Users\<User>\AppData\Local\shellcaster\ on Windows

#download_path = "~/.local/share/shellcaster/"


# Command used to play episodes.
# * If the value contains %s, it is used to indicate where the file or URL is
#   inserted in the command, without any quotation marks around. This is to
#   ensure a better flexibility if a more complex command is used.
#   Example: `cat '%s' | mpv -` becomes `cat '/home/you/the file.mp3' | mpv -`
# * If the value does not contain %s, the file path or URL is appended to the
#   command, enclosed in double quotes.
#   Example: `vlc` becomes `vlc "/home/you/the file.mp3"`
# Default: vlc

#play_command = "vlc"


# Configures what happens when new episodes are found as podcasts are
# synced:
#  - "always" will automatically download all new episodes;
#  - "ask-selected" will open a popup window to let you select which
#    episodes to download, with all of them selected by default;
#  - "ask-unselected" will open a popup window to let you select which
#    episodes to download, with NONE of them selected by default;
#  - "never" will never automatically download new episodes.
# Default: "ask-unselected"

#download_new_episodes = "ask-unselected"


# Maximum number of files to download simultaneously. Setting this too
# high could result in network requests being denied. A good general
# guide would be to set this to the number of processor cores on your
# computer.
# Default: 3

#simultaneous_downloads = 3


# Maximum number of times to retry connecting to a URL to sync a
# podcast or download an episode.
# Default: 3

#max_retries = 3


# Prefix and suffix added to the name of each downloaded files.
# Specifiers beginning with a % can be used to format the publication
# date of the episode.
# For example, "%Y-%m-%d" is the date in the format "YYYY-MM-DD" and
# "%H:%M:%S" is the time of the day in the format "HH:MM:SS".
#
# The complete list of supported specifiers is available here:
# https://docs.rs/chrono/latest/chrono/format/strftime/index.html
# Note however that depending on your system and locale, %D and %x might
# not be supported because they can add slashes in the filename.
#
# The original Shellcaster had a behaviour that was equivalent to
# setting filename_prefix = "", filename_suffix = "_%Y%m%d_%H%M%S".
# Shellcaster-Classic defaults to
# filename_prefix = "%Y%m%d_", filename_suffix = ""

#filename_prefix = "%Y%m%d_"
#filename_suffix = ""



[keybindings]

# Keybindings must be an array of one or more strings.
# If you want to distinguish between a regular alphanumeric key
# and Shift+key, you can use the capital letter that you would normally
# type when pressing Shift+key (e.g., Shift+"r" will give you "R").

# Other special characters and their config string:
# Arrow keys: "Left", "Right", "Up", "Down"
# Ctrl+key: "C-key" (e.g., "C-r" means Ctrl+"r")
# Shift+key: "S-key" (e.g., "S-Del" means Shift+Delete)
# Insert ("Ins"), Delete ("Del"), Home ("Home"), End ("End"),
# Page up ("PgUp"), Page down ("PgDn"), Tab ("Tab")
# Enter ("Enter"), Escape ("Esc") -- be aware that on some terminals the
# Escape key waits for further input before passing it along to
# shellcaster, so you might notice a delay with this key

# Don't try to use backslash, or you're gonna have a bad time

[colors]

# Colors can be identified in three ways:
# 1. Using color names defined by your terminal:
#    - black, darkgrey, red, darkred, green, darkgreen, yellow,
#      darkyellow, blue, darkblue, magenta, darkmagenta, cyan,
#      darkcyan, white, or grey
#    - The special color name "terminal" can also be used to specify
#      your terminal's default foreground or background color; this is
#      particularly useful if your terminal background is transparent --
#      use "terminal" for the background colors below.
# 2. Using a hex code in the format "#ff0000" or "#FF0000" to specify
#    RGB values.
# 3. Using an RGB value in the format "rgb(255, 0, 0)" where each number
#    is a value between 0 and 255.
# Note that, as might be expected, the ability to set colors depends on
# the capabilities of your terminal. Config options set below are ignored
# on terminals without the ability to add/change colors.

# all regular text
normal_foreground = "grey"
normal_background = "black"

# colors for bolded text, including podcasts/episodes that are unplayed,
# and some titles

# text for error messages
